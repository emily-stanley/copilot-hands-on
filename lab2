    Check if a number is prime.

    A prime number (or a prime) is a natural number greater than 1 that is not a product 
    of two smaller natural numbers. A natural number greater than 1 that is not prime is 
    called a composite number. 

    Parameters:
    n (int): The number to check.

    Returns:
    bool: True if the number is prime, False otherwise.

#explain the code above line-by-line
#is_prime function takes an integer n as its argument and returns a boolean value   
#The first line of the function checks if the number is less than 2 and returns False if it is
#The second line of the function iterates through the range of 2 to the square root of n + 1
#The third line of the function checks if n is divisible by i and returns False if it is
#The fourth line of the function returns True if the number is prime
#The function returns False if the number is not prime

# q: what does the function above do?
# a: The function checks if a number is prime and returns True if it is and False if it is not
